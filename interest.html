        <h1>My Interest in IT</h1>
          <p>My interest in Information Technology stems from its diversity and impact on our everyday lives.</p>
          <p>I was first interested in IT when I was in primary school designing custom Minecraft servers for friends which involved installing various plugins, troubleshooting and setting up permission nodes. This later developed into wanting to build my first custom gaming computer as I started to realise the potential of these machines.</p>
          <p>During high school I excelled in python programming, web design and video production. I also studied 'Information Process Technology' and 'Software Design and Development', which is where I further developed my understanding of Information Systems and Software design.</p>
          <p>I have chosen to study at RMIT as I want to get started on my career in IT as it offers flexible study for my busy lifestyle.</p>
          <p>I'm expecting to further develop my current knowledge of IT systems, programming and how IT can be applied to situations in todayâ€™s society.</p>
