      <h1>Round 16 Women's World Cup: Brazil vs. Australia</h1>
      <p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, 1:00 p.m. EDT</p>
      <p><strong>Where:</strong> Mocton Stadium, Moncton, Canada</p>
      <p>If they beat old foe, Brazil, it will be the third time in a row that the Matilda's have made it to the quarter finals of the Women's World Cup.</p>
      <p>In 2007, when they reached the final eight, it was Brazil who thwarted their run with a 3-2 win. Brazil went on to be runners up against a better German side 2-0: the best that Brazil has achieved to date.  In 2011, Brazil caused the Aussies some pain again with a narrow 1-0 loss in Group D.  So you could say these teams have some World Cup history.</p>
      <p>Can Brazil, led by the amazing Marta (like other Brazilian soccer players before her, no family name required!) best the Matildas in three consecutive World Cups?  Marta has had a quiet Cup so far, but as five-time FIFA World Player of the Year and the tournament's all-time leading goal-scorer, she will always be dangerous.</p>
      <p>Or will the Matildas, having grown in skill and experience from the foundations of the young 2011 World Cup team, begin to even the ledger?</p>
