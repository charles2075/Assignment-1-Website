    		<h1>Overview</h1>
    		<p>My Project Idea is based on the development of a Shopping Centre Navigation Mobile Application. This application would allow customers to navigate Shopping centres in an efficient and timely manner, whilst being accessible to all mobile phone users.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h1>Motivation</h1>
    		<p>The development of this application will be extremely useful to all shopping centre customers, especially those with disabilities and new employees. Shopping centres currently take advantage of the ‘Gruen Transfer’, this is a psychological advertising effect which overwhelms the customer creating the opportunity for unplanned sales. I find this practice unethical, and so by providing customers with an application that allows them to bypass the confusion put in place by the shopping centre they will be able to make clear and concise shopping purchases. It may also be able to help those with disabilities by acting as a platform for auditory and visual navigation of the shopping centre.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h1>Description</h1>
    		<h3>Advanced Location Accuracy</h3>
    		<p>Current GPS navigation systems are not as accurate as Wi-Fi positioning systems. My software will use the combination of both GPS and Wi-Fi which will enable pinpoint accuracy of the user’s location within the shopping centre. This is a key feature as GPS alone is only accurate within three to five metres depending on the signal strength. Furthermore, GPS accuracy is also significantly decreased with the combination of multiple concrete walls and ceilings which are a common factor of the environment.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Disability</h3>
    		<p>Important disability features must be implemented, such as; auditory and visual cues. Voice directions and on-screen directions will enable the use by those with a disability, further making the application more accessible. The application could also incorporate a distress button which sends a signal notifying that you require assistance, this function would ping the shopping centre your location if it detects you have either fallen or purposefully requested help.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
    		<p>In conjunction with the Wi-Fi positioning system, an augmented reality engine will be implemented to give the user direction cues whilst navigating. This can also be used to enhance the user's experience by providing them with information about various stores as they pass by.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Advertisement Opportunity</h3>
    		<p>With the negative impact that this application will have on the shopping centres ‘Gruen Transfer’, an In-app advertisement Opportunity arises. Advertisements could be in the form of coupons, rewards, and loyalty cards. This will make users more susceptible to making purchases whilst making information less intrusive. Users would have the option to create personal accounts containing data of reoccurring stores visited and purchases. This would allow the development of a further enhanced shopping experience tailored to suit the user’s needs.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Integrated Search Engine</h3>
    		<p>An integrated search engine combined with a backend database containing every store's location will allow the user to find their request efficiently and effectively. This search engine will not be limited to store locations, but could also contain the locations of toilets, food courts, movie theatres, etc.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Offline mode</h3>
    		<p>The function of an offline mode would further widen the spectrum of the devices that the application would be available to. For example, it would allow the use of various devices without GPS capability. This offline navigation would function based on ‘trilateration’, which is the utilisation of wireless transmitters to determine the location of the device based on the devices transmitted signals. Once the device regains connection to one of the access points it can then update itself with pending updates.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h3>Security and Maintenance</h3>
    		<p>Management for the shopping centre will have access to a web-based overview of alerts posted by store employees. This will allow for instant action in response to thefts, hazards, accidents, and threats. This overview gives store owners an extremely effective way of communicating with the management of the shopping centre. This feature, combined with the navigation system in place grants security with the fastest available routes further increasing their response time.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
    		<p>The front end for the application will be created on Java, Swift, HTML, and JavaScript. The backend will be a server consisting of python, java, and JavaScript. The Application solely relies on a Wi-Fi positioning system, this will require a vast array of access points being placed effectively around the designated area; without doing this the application would cease to function. ‘Mapwize.io’ is currently developing an open-source indoor location API, utilising Wi-Fi to further increase location accuracy for the device. This API acts as an integral part of the development of the Wi-Fi positioning system.</p>

			<p>The feasibility of this project will be dependent on the funding needed to acquire the skills and knowledge of programming languages involved. The network infrastructure will also need to be overhauled which will be expensive considering the grade of equipment needed. I believe this project will be possible in a few years as advanced networking solutions will be more common further decreasing the pricing for the needed components. With the influx of people undertaking career's in IT, it should be easy to find the appropriate programmers and network administrators to make this possible.</p>
    		<p>&nbsp;</p>
    		<h1>Outcome</h1>
    		<p>If successful, this project will further increase the efficiency of operations within the shopping centre, whilst also subjecting users to an enhanced and tailor-made user experience. The navigation system will be the solution to the confusion brought onto customers by shopping centre whilst also increasing sales ethically, and expanding profitability. This development will require employees to be trained in the use of the new system, which may result in a decrease in productivity. To avoid this, I suggest that this system is integrated with the pilot conversion approach.</p>
